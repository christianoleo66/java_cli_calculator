# Java CLI Calculator

A Command Line (CLI) Calculator written in Java.

# Acceptance Criteria

For each release, [create a release on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and send a link to the release page to your acceptance tester. Your acceptance tester can be the person who looks after you, other interns or mutiple people. The idea is that you get feedback and guidance early and often to accelerate both learning and results.

## Release 1

- I want to sum to whole numbers.
- I want to substract to whole numbers.

For now and any future releases:

- I want to enter the numbers via command prompt.
- I want to see each result visually.

## Release 2

- I want to devide to whole numbers.
  - Devision by zero is not allowed
- I want to multiply to whole numbers.

## Release 3

- I want sum, substract, devide and multiply with decimals.

## Release 4

- I want to sum, substract, devide and multiply with multiple numbers both whole and decimal.

## Release 5

- I want to get the radical of a number.
